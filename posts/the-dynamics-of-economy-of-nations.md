The city of Nogales, on the border between USA and Mexico is cut in half by a fence.

If you stand by this fence and look north, Nogales, Arizona, USA stretches out ahead of you. It's residence are relatively well-off, have long average lifespans and most children receive high school diplomas. Property rights are secure and people know they will get to enjoy most of the benefts from their investments. Free elections provide residents with the opportunity to replace politicians with whom they are not satisfed.

If you look south instead, you see Nogales, in Sonora, Mexico. Even though this is a relatively wealthy part of Mexico, the residents here are in general considerably poorer than on the north side of the fence. Organised crime makes starting and running companies risky. Corrupt politicians are difcult to remove, even if the chances of this have improved since Mexico democratised, just over 20 years ago. Why do these two halves of the same city have such vastly diferent living conditions? Geographically they are in the same place, so factors such as the climate are exactly the same. The two populations also have similar origins; historically, the northern area was actually in Mexico, so long-term residents of the city have many common ancestors. There are also many cultural similarities. People eat similar food and listen to more or less the same kind of music on both sides of the fence
